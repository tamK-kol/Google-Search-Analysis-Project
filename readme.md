## Google Search Analysis

This project demonstrates how to use the Google Trends API to analyze trends related to "Cloud Computing" (You can use and topic of your choice). The analysis includes interest over time, interest by region, top trending topics, and related queries. Additionally, the project includes visualization of the data using Matplotlib.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Install the necessary libraries using pip:
    pip install pytrends pandas matplotlib

### Libraries
a. pytrends: A simple API for automated access to the Google Trends.
b. pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
c. matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

### Step-by-Step Process
1. Connect to Google Trends:
a. Import the necessary libraries (pandas, pytrends, and matplotlib).
b. Establish a connection to Google Trends by creating an instance of TrendReq.

2. Build the Payload:
a. Define the keyword list (e.g., ["Cloud Computing"]).
b. Build the payload using the build_payload method, specifying parameters such as the category and timeframe.

3. Interest Over Time:
a. Retrieve the interest over time data for the specified keyword.
b. Sort the data by the keyword interest in descending order.
c. Select the top 10 data points to analyze and visualize.

4. Visualize Interest Over Time:
a. Create a bar chart to visualize the top 10 interest over time data points.
b. Configure the plot with titles, labels, and formatting to enhance readability.

5. Interest by Region:
a. Retrieve the interest by region data for the specified keyword.
b. Sort the data by the keyword interest in descending order.
c. Select the top 10 regions to analyze and visualize.

6. Visualize Interest by Region:
a. Create a bar chart to visualize the interest by region data.
b. Configure the plot with titles, labels, and formatting to enhance readability.

7. Finding Top Trending Topics:
a. Retrieve the top trending topics globally for the specified year (e.g., 2023).
b. Display the top 10 trending topics for further analysis.

8. Search for Related Queries:
a. Build the payload again for the keyword to fetch related queries.
b. Introduce a delay to avoid hitting the rate limit of the Google Trends API.
c. Retrieve and display the related queries for the keyword.

9. Keyword Suggestions:
a. Fetch keyword suggestions related to the specified keyword.
b. Convert the suggestions to a DataFrame and display the data.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of "Cloud Computing" trends using Google Trends. It covers various aspects, including interest over time, interest by region, top trending topics, and related queries. The results are visualized using Matplotlib for better understanding and insights.
